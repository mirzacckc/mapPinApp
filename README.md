## Humidity and Temperature Meter
It is an application that shows the locations, temperature and humidity values for specific provinces on the map of Turkey.

## Project Details

There are pins in 8 provinces on the map of Turkey. On the right side of the map, there is a card list showing the detailed temperature, humidity and dates of the provinces where the pins are located. When you click on one of the pins on the map, a pop up showing the temperature and humidity rates of that province opens.

There are also 2 buttons in the pop up to update the temperature and humidity values. Clicking on any of the pins from the list on the right side opens a pop-up showing the temperature and humidity by zooming on the map of that province. Finally, there is a search section on the top right of the page where you can search between provinces.
